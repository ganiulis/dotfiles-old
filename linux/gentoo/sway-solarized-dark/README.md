# Introduction

My [Sway](https://swaywm.org) setup for keyboard-centric development. Built and
tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad P52.

Themed around [Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) with some
extra colors.

Inspired by the [MacOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/) interface.

# Instructions

1. Download required fonts with `./dl-fonts.sh`.
2. Symlink regular user configs with `./ln-user.sh`.
