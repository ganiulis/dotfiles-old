# Introduction

This is what I use for my MacBook Pro ([macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/)).

# Instructions

There are scripts which link the required configuration files together:

1. Find the shell script for the desired config.
2. Create links for the config with `ln-{config}.sh`.
3. Check if the symlink has been created and if any previous configs are stored away.

Alternatively, use `cp-{config].sh` to copy files instead of symlinking them.

# Configurations

1. Shell: [Fish](https://fishshell.com) (`{cmd}-fish.sh`)
