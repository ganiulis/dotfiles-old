# Introduction

Inspired by the various configuration options shared in
[r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) and the
[unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io).

A collection of directories and files meant to serve as templates for my
machines.

I put up specific files under version control which make sense to me, such as
customization or lists of packages.

To keep each template consistent, I pull this repository and `ln -s ...`
specific directories and files.

Complete templates:

- [Linux](linux/common)

Incomplete templates:

- [Gentoo Linux (in Solarized Dark)](linux/gentoo/sway-solarized-dark)

Future templates (which I may or may not do):

1. [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
2. [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/)
3. [SteamOS](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos)
4. [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org)
5. [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org)
6. [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org)
