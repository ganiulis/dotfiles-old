# Introduction

Inspired by the various configuration options shared in [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) and [the unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io).

A collection of directories and files meant to serve as templates for my
machines.

I put up specific files under version control which make sense to me, such as
customization or lists of packages.

To keep each template consistent, I pull this repository and `ln -s ...`
specific directories and files.

Incomplete templates:

- [Gentoo Linux (in Solarized Dark)](linux/gentoo/sway-solarized-dark)

Future templates (which I may or may not do):

1. [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
   (`linux/linux-from-scratch/...`)
2. [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/) (`macos/sonoma`)
